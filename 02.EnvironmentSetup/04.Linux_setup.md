# Setting Up a Modern C++ Development Environment on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04)

Linux is a popular platform for C++ development, with many tools and IDEs available. This guide will help you set up a modern C++ development environment on Ubuntu 24.04 using Visual Studio Code, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg. We will install the necessary compilers and integrate them with Visual Studio Code, CMake, and vcpkg. The steps shown here are specific to Ubuntu 24.04 but they can easily be adapted to fit any distribution. Let's get started!

## 1. Download and Install Clang 19

Clang is a popular C++ compiler that is known for keeping up with the latest C++ standards and good error messages. We will prioritize it on Linux, because at the time of this writing, it is one of the best compilers that integrate CMake well to give us a good experience using C++20 Modules, one of the coolest features introduced in the C++20. The latest stable version at the time of this writing is 19. Clang 19 can be installed using the official LLVM script. This script automatically sets up the necessary APT repositories and installs the requested version. To install Clang 19:

- Open a terminal.
- Run the following commands:
```shell
    wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
    chmod +x llvm.sh
    sudo ./llvm.sh 19 all
```

This script will:

- Add the official LLVM APT repository.
- Install Clang 19 and related tools.
- Update the package list and dependencies.

Once completed, verify the installation with:
```shell
    clang-19 --version
```

You should see output similar to:
```shell
    clang version 19.0.0
    Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
    Thread model: posix
    InstalledDir: /usr/bin
```

Now clang-19 is installed on your system. But we need to make it so that we can call clang through the command `clang` instead of `clang-19`. There are many ways to do this, but will just use `update-alternatives`.  Run the following commands:
```shell
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-19 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-19 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clangd clangd /usr/bin/clangd-19 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/lldb lldb /usr/bin/lldb-19 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/lld lld /usr/bin/lld-19 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-tidy clang-tidy /usr/bin/clang-tidy-19 100
```

These will make sure that `clang-19` is the default `clang` on your system. Additionaly many tools associated with clang will also be set up to use the clang-19 version.

You can now verify that your tools are accessible through the following commands: 
```shell
clang --version
clang++ --version
clangd --version
lldb --version
lld --version
clang-tidy --version
```

## 2. Install CMake (Latest Version)

CMake is a popular build system generator that is widely used in the C++ community. It is used to generate build files for various build systems, such as Ninja, Make, and Visual Studio. I know this may be music to your ears if this is your first exploration of the C++ world, but CMake is a tools that will make it very easy to stitch up several C++ files to make a modular and manageable project. To install the latest version of CMake for Linux, follow these steps:

- Go to the [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/).
- Download the latest install script for Linux. At the time of this writing, the latest script is [this one](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.31.6/cmake-3.31.6-linux-x86_64.sh).
- You can download the script using the terminal with the following command:
```shell
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.31.6/cmake-3.31.6-linux-x86_64.sh
```
- Make the script executable:
```shell
chmod +x cmake-3.31.6-linux-x86_64.sh
```
- Run the script to install CMake:
```shell
sudo ./cmake-3.31.6-linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/opt/cmake-3.31.6 --skip-license
```
This will install CMake in the `/opt/cmake-3.31.6` directory. You can change the installation directory by modifying the `--prefix` option.

- Add CMake to your system PATH by running the following commands:
```shell
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cmake cmake /opt/cmake-3.31.6/bin/cmake 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ctest ctest /opt/cmake-3.31.6/bin/ctest 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cpack cpack /opt/cmake-3.31.6/bin/cpack 100
```
This will make the CMake tools accessible through the `cmake`, `ctest`, and `cpack` commands, and will point to the latest version that we just installed. To be able to do what we'll do in the course, you need at least CMake 3.28.0, but it's always good to have the latest version.

- Now you should have CMake installed and you can verify it by running:
```shell    
cmake --version
```
This should output something like:
```shell    
cmake version 3.31.6
```


## 3. Install Ninja (Build System)

Ninja is a fast build system used with CMake. It was built by Google to be faster than Make, and it is widely used in the C++ community. To install Ninja on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal.
- Run the commands below to install some pre-required tools like wget and unzip:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget unzip
```
- Go to the Ninja Git Releases page and download the latest release. At the time of this writing, the latest release is [ninja-linux.zip](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/download/v1.12.1/ninja-linux.zip)
- You can download it using the wget command:
```shell
wget https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/download/v1.12.1/ninja-linux.zip   
```
- Unzip the downloaded file:
```shell
unzip ninja-linux.zip
```
- Move the ninja executable to the `/usr/bin` directory:
```shell
sudo mv ninja /usr/bin/ninja
```
- Make the ninja executable:
```shell
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ninja
```
- Verify the installation by running:
```shell
ninja --version
```
You should see output similar to:
```shell
1.12.1
```

## 4. Install git (Version Control System)

Git is a popular version control system used by many developers. It is used to track changes in source code and collaborate with other developers. We will first need it to download and install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html), our package manager, but we'll use it later on to manage changes across files in our projects. To install Git on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal.
- Run the following command to install Git:
```shell
sudo apt-get install git
```
- Verify the installation by running:
```shell
git --version
```
You should see output similar to:
```shell
git version 2.25.1
```

## 5. Install vcpkg (Package Manager)

vcpkg is a C++ package manager that simplifies the process of installing and managing C++ libraries. It is widely used in the C++ community and integrates well with CMake. To install vcpkg on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal.
- Change to the directory where you want to install vcpkg. For example, to install it in your home directory, as I like to do,  run:
```shell
cd ~
```
- Clone the vcpkg repository from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
```
- Change to the vcpkg directory:
```shell
cd vcpkg
```
- Run the following command to bootstrap vcpkg:
    ```bash
    bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    ```
- This will build the vcpkg executable.
- Confirm that you have access to the vcpkg executable by running the following command inside the `vcpkg` directory:
    ```bash
    vcpkg --version
    ```
- You should see the installed version of vcpkg like below:
    ```
    2022.01.11-nohash
    ```
- If you see the installed version of vcpkg, you have successfully installed vcpkg. If you don't see this information, please check the installation steps again.
- Now, you can use vcpkg to install third-party libraries and use them in your projects. We will cover how this is done through CMake in the course.

- Setup a `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to point to the vcpkg directory. This will make it easier to use vcpkg with CMake. On Linux, you can do this by:
    - Opening the `.bashrc` file in your home directory using the editor of your choice. For example, you can use `nano`:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
    - Add the following lines to the end of the file:
        ```bash
        export PATH=/opt/cmake-3.31.6/bin:$PATH
        export VCPKG_ROOT=~/vcpkg
        export PATH=$VCPKG_ROOT:$PATH
        ```
    - These lines to the following: 
        - Add the CMake binary directory to the PATH environment variable. This allows us to call CMake from any directory on the system.
        - Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to the vcpkg directory. This is needed by our CMake projects.
        - Add the vcpkg directory to the PATH environment variable. This allows us to call vcpkg from any directory on the system.
        - Attention: You need to adapt these to your specific installation paths. For example my cmake is installed in `/opt/cmake-3.31.6` and my vcpkg is in `~/vcpkg`, and these are the paths I used in the example above.
    - Save the file and exit the editor.
    - Run the following command to apply the changes:
        ```bash
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```
    - Now you can use the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable in your CMake projects to find vcpkg and the libraries you installed with it.
  
## 6. Install Visual Studio Code (Required)

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful code editor that supports C++ development. We will use it to write and build our C++ projects in the course. To install:

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Open Visual Studio Code and install the following extensions:
  - C++ Environment Extensions (**Choose one of these**):
    - C++ Extension (from Microsoft)
    - Clang tools (This is  what I will use in the course): 
      - Clangd (from LLVM)
      - CodeLLDB (from Vadim Chugunov)
  - CMake Tools (from Microsoft)
  - CMake (from Microsoft)
  - Other extesions I will be using in the course: 
    - Docker (Optional)
    - Dev Containers (Optional)
    - Vim (Optional)
  - You can install these extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar and searching for them in the Extensions Marketplace.

## 7. Verify Your Installation

To check that everything is set up correctly, open a new Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 or Developer PowerShell for VS 2022 window and run the following commands. We need to go through the developer prompt or PowerShell to ensure that the environment variables needed for the `cl` compiler are set correctly.:

```bash
clang --version  # Check Clang
cmake --version  # Check CMake
ninja --version  # Check Ninja
vcpkg --version  # Check vcpkg
```
If all commands return valid versions, your setup is complete!


## 8. Put It All Together in Visual Studio Code: Building and Running your First C++ Program

If all the setup was successful, you can now use one of the template projects as a starting point. We'll use C++20 Modules as a first-class citizen in the course, so you can start with the 01.Project_template_modules template project.

Open the folder 01.Project_template_modules in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by dragging the folder into Visual Studio Code or by opening Visual Studio Code and selecting `File > Open Folder...` and selecting the folder.

Our project uses **CMake Presets** to configure and build the project easily. To make everything work as expected, select `View > Command Palette...` and start typing `CMake: Select Configure Preset`. Choose the option when it appears, and you'll see a list of presets. For Linux with Clang, select the `Linux Clang++ Builds with the clang++ compiler` preset.

![CMake Configure Preset Selection](./images/cmake_select_configure_presets_clang.png)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** At this point, if you are using the SFML library from the `vcpkg.json` file, you may get errors stating that some files are missing or not found and that you can install them using `sudo apt-get install ...`. You can just to to your terminal and install the missing packages as suggested. Here is of I got them installed: `apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libudev-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`.

After selecting the preset, your project will begin configuration. A terminal window will open at the bottom of Visual Studio Code showing the output of the configuration process. After a few seconds, you should see a message indicating that the build files have been written, something like:

```bash
[cmake] -- Detecting CXX compile features - done
[cmake] -- Configuring done (3.9s)
[cmake] -- Generating done (0.0s)
[cmake] -- Build files have been written to: /home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/linux_clang
```

If you see something different or an error message, please ask for help in the course Q&A section.

Now let's understand what CMake did for us. From the output, you can see that the project is stored in `/home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules`.

CMake generated a new folder named `build` inside the project folder where build files are stored. The `clang` folder inside the `build` folder contains the actual build files.

This happens because of the settings in the `CMakePresets.json` file in the project folder, which tells CMake how to configure the project. You don't need to understand all the details right now, just know where your build files are stored.

Next, build the project by selecting `View > Command Palette...` and typing `CMake: Build`. When the build process completes successfully, you should see output similar to:

```cmake
...
[build] [1/6] Scanning /home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/main.cpp for CXX dependencies
[build] [2/6] Scanning /home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/utilities.ixx for CXX dependencies
[build] utilities.ixx
[build] [3/6] Generating CXX dyndep file CMakeFiles/Rocket.dir/Debug/CXX.dd
[build] [4/6] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/Rocket.dir/Debug/utilities.ixx.obj
[build] utilities.ixx
[build] [5/6] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/Rocket.dir/Debug/main.cpp.obj
[build] [6/6] Linking CXX executable Debug/Rocket
[driver] Build completed: 00:00:01.352
[build] Build finished with exit code 0
```

CMake compiles the source files and links them together to create an executable. The executable is named `Rocket` (no .exe extension on Linux) and is stored in the `Debug` folder inside the `linux_clang` folder. The full path in our example would be `/home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket`.

This executable is the output of your programming efforts. To run it, click the play button at the bottom of the window.

![Run Button](./images/play_button.png)

Clicking this will run the executable, and you'll see the program's output in the terminal window:

```
$ "/home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket"
Hello, World!
```

The output is `Hello, World!`, with the terminal showing that it's running the `Rocket` binary from the `build/linux_clang/Debug/` directory.

## 9. Debugging C++ and Running Things Like a Pro in Visual Studio Code

To take full advantage of Visual Studio Code and the tools we installed, let's set up debugging and learn some shortcuts.

First, ensure your project folder structure looks like this:

```
  ├── 01.Project_template_modules/
  │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
  │   ├── CMakePresets.json
  │   ├── main.cpp
  │   ├── utilities.ixx
  │   ├── vcpkg.json
  │   └── build
```

Click on the `Run and Debug` icon on the left sidebar of Visual Studio Code (it looks like a play button with a bug on it).

![Run and Debug Icon](./images/run_and_debug.png)

Since we don't have configurations yet, click the `create a launch.json file` link and select the `CodeLLDB: Launch` configuration. This works because we installed the `CodeLLDB` extension earlier, which helps Visual Studio Code understand and debug C++ code.

The generated `launch.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<executable file>",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace `<executable file>` with the path to the executable: `build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket`. The updated file should look like:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Save the file. Now you can go to the Run Menu and click on `Start Without Debugging` or press `Ctrl + F5` to run the program.

To see debugging in action, let's modify our `main.cpp` file:

```cpp    
int main(){
    fmt::print("Hello, World!\n");
    fmt::print("one\n");
    fmt::print("two\n");
    fmt::print("three\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Rebuild the program using `CMake: Build` from the Command Palette or by pressing `F7`.

Run the program with `Ctrl + F5` to see the output:

```
Hello, World!
one
two
three
```

Now let's debug it step by step. Set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of line 11 in `main.cpp` where a red dot will appear.

To run the program in debug mode, go to the Run Menu and click `Start Debugging` or press `F5`. The program will pause at your breakpoint.

![Debugging Window](./images/debug_window.png)

You can now see the program state in the left panel, including variables and the call stack. To execute line by line, click the `Step Over` button or press `F10`. Each time you step over, the next line executes and the program pauses again.

## 10. Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a modern C++ development environment on Linux using Visual Studio Code, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg. We installed Clang, CMake, Ninja, Git, vcpkg, and Visual Studio Code. We also learned how to build and run a C++ program in Visual Studio Code and how to debug it.

We covered a lot of ground, and I hope you now feel comfortable with these tools and are ready to start using C++ to build amazing projects. If you have any questions or run into issues, please ask in the course Q&A section.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** You'll need the launch.json file you set up earlier for other projects we create in this course. Copy it to the root of any new project to make building and debugging easier. If the structure of the project changes, you may need to adapt the path to the executable in the launch.json file.
