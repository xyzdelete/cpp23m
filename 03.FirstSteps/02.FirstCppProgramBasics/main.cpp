/*
    . A C++ starter project using CMake and bringing in fmt right out of the
   box. . Uses vcpkg as a dependency manager . Build instructions: . Bare hands
   with CMake: . cmake -S . -B build . cmake --build build

        . With CMake presets (VS Code):
            . Select configure preset
            . Select build preset
            . Use the run and debug buttons: We can debug application right from
   the start.

        . Note:
            . There are other ways to build but we'll focus on these two in the
   course. . You can use the docker containers that come with the course for a
   fully reproducible build environment. . one for gcc 14 [link] . one for clang
   18 [link]

    . Requirements:
        . A modern C++ compiler:
            . eg: gcc 14, clang 16 or latest msvc.
        . cmake 3.30 or up
        . ninja 1.11 or up
        . vcpkg and setting up the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable
            . how to update vcpkg:
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/about/faq#how-do-i-update-vcpkg . A
   debugger: . eg: gdb, lldb, or the visual studio debugger . Goood to have: .
   Git

        . Editor:
            . VS Code:
                . The C++ extension
                . The CMake Tools extension
                . The CMake extension
                . NOTE: These are required to give you the best experience.

        . Know where a binary is:
            . Linux: which command
                . eg: which ninja
            . Windows: Get-command
                . eg: Get-command ninja

    . Philosophy:
        . All non module looking code should be hidden away in the utilities
   module.
